    <h2 id="section-author">About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello stranger! I have been looking forward to meeting you. I am Akanksha
      Shruti and having found you here, it’s safe to assume that we are
      congruent in our love for ‘Everything Science’. I love science and I love
      writing and through it, dispensing everything I know. There’s an advantage
      to it, I put in the effort, you enjoy the fruits, and in turn I improve
      upon my concepts and skills by welcoming all your suggestions and
      constructive criticisms.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-page">About the Page</h2>
    <p>
      This page is my first foray into discussing and explaining my
      understanding of miscellaneous scientific concepts that I have come across
      through different mediums. Here, I keep a coherent track of everything I
      have consumed and assimilated. You will find here pockets of easily
      digestible, casual reads. I hope you enjoy my work as much as I enjoyed
      creating it.
